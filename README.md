# Music Library

## Project Goals

- Build a web basic music API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

The focus of this project is to build a basic **Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.

## Getting started
### Backend Setup
Run `bundle install` to install all the required gemfiles
