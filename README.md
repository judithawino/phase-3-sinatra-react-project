# Music Library

## Project Goals

- Build a web basic music API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

The focus of this project is to build a basic **Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.

## Getting started
### Backend Setup
Run `bundle install` to install all the required gemfiles
#### Starting local server
You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```
This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).
