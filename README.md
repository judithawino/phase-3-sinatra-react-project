# Music Library

## Project Goals

- Build a web basic music API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

The focus of this project is to build a basic **Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.

## Getting started
### Backend Setup
Run `bundle install` to install all the required gemfiles



- **Create** a new todo
- **Read** a list of all todos
- **Update** an individual todo
- **Delete** a todo

A `Todo` can be tagged with a `Category`, so that each todo _belongs to_ a
category and each category _has many_ todos.

You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

### Frontend Setup
